# my-recurring-date-picker
This app is ideal for situations where users need to schedule or set reminders for events that happen on a recurring basis, such as:  Setting recurring tasks in a to-do app
Features:
Date Selection:

Users can select a start date and optionally an end date for a recurring event or task.
Recurring Options:

Users can select different recurring patterns like:
Daily
Weekly
Monthly
Yearly
This allows users to specify how often the event or task repeats.
Customization of Recurrence:

Users can customize the recurrence patterns:
For example, they can choose to repeat every X days/weeks/months/years.
They can select specific days of the week (e.g., repeat on Mondays and Fridays).
They can also choose options like "the second Tuesday of every month."
Visual Preview:

A mini calendar displays a visual preview of the selected dates based on the recurrence options chosen. This helps users verify the recurring dates.
Date Range:

Users can define a start date and an optional end date for the recurring event.
This allows flexibility for both indefinite and finite recurring events.
Reusable Components:

The app is designed using modular, reusable components (e.g., DatePicker, RecurrenceOptions, DateRange, MiniCalendar), so it can be easily integrated into other applications or extended for further use.
Use Case:
This app is ideal for situations where users need to schedule or set reminders for events that happen on a recurring basis, such as:

Setting recurring tasks in a to-do app (e.g., a task that repeats every Friday).
Scheduling recurring meetings or appointments (e.g., a monthly meeting on the first Monday of every month).
Managing reminders for events that occur periodically (e.g., birthdays, anniversaries, etc.).
It provides flexibility and customization for users to specify exactly how and when events should repeat, making it an essential feature for productivity apps or calendar-based applications.

How it works:
The user selects a start date and (optionally) an end date.
The user chooses a recurrence pattern (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).
The user customizes the recurrence pattern (e.g., every 2 weeks on Mondays).
The app shows a visual preview of the recurring dates in a mini-calendar.
All chosen information is stored and managed in a state management system (Zustand in this case).
Example Scenarios:
A user wants to create a weekly recurring task starting from October 1st, repeating every Monday and Wednesday.
A user wants to set a monthly reminder for a team meeting, repeating on the second Tuesday of every month.
